## Arduino heart rate/pulse sensors
**A comparison of pulse sensors for Arduino.**
- **Pulse sensor from https://pulsesensor.com/** *Unfortunately the older version, I bought it a long time ago and I don't know if mine is the original or cheap clone, probably there are differences not only in price.*
- **DFRobot heart rate sensor**
- **MH-ET Live Pulse sensor (MAX30102)**
- **Iduino pulse sensor** *Please don't you dare to bring this crap to my classes trying to do semester project!*

*Remember, these modules aren't certified for medical use.*
